There is a 'requirements' file in 'Codes' folder.

Go to the terminal and type 
pip install -r requirements.txt
then hit enter.

Put your images(from which you want to extract texts) in 'Resources' folder.
Then run 'ocr_main.py' file.

(*) A text file will be generated with the recognized texts.

Thanks.
